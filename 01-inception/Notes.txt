Ans - 

In the context of script tags, async and defer are attributes used to control when a script is executed.

async: The script is executed asynchronously, meaning it won't block the rendering of the page, and it will be executed as soon as it's available.
defer: The script is executed in order after the HTML is fully parsed. It won't block the rendering, and multiple scripts with defer will be executed in the order they appear in the document.
